- Make Sensitive Media Ecosystem w/ Reader Reports.
- Seoul Editors Lab 2018 focused on engagement and community building

## Problem Statement
- Minorities are excluded from the news.

## Target Audience
- Minorities
- Women, Disabled, LGBT, Foreigners, etc. 

## Our Solution
- Sensitive Media Ecosystem w/ Reader Reports

### Reader Reports
- Readers can report hate speech of articles.
- Database of hate speech can be constructed.

### Sensible CMS
- With machine learning, we can build a CMS which can check hate speech automatically.
- Writers can self-check their own articles, even can check its ‘Diversity Index’.

### Feedback emails
- We can send feedback emails to the readers who sent reports.
- This will engage more and more.
- In this email, we can also put ’No-hate-speech stories’

## Further Directions
- Media can treat stories whose diversity index is high more important.
- Not only for minorities but also whole readers.
- We can build the news community which does not exclude minorities.
